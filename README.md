### Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software

### Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

### Idea

A **Web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software** is a tool designed to simulate and streamline the recruitment or hiring process. It allows organizations to assess and manage the interactions between selectors (e.g., HR managers, recruiters) and applicants (e.g., job candidates) through an online platform. 

Key features typically include:
1. **Applicant Tracking**: Allows recruiters to track applications, progress, and responses.
2. **Simulation of Interviews or Assessments**: Simulates various stages of the hiring process, such as interviews, skill tests, or personality assessments.
3. **Automated Feedback**: Provides automated results and feedback based on performance in the simulation.
4. **Decision Support**: Helps selectors compare candidates, manage data, and make more informed hiring decisions.
5. **Customization**: Tailored for different job positions or industries, enabling specific simulations (e.g., technical tests, behavioral assessments).

This type of software helps streamline the recruitment process, reduce human bias, and improve decision-making efficiency.

### Technology Stack

A web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software typically uses a technology stack that includes front-end technologies like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript frameworks (React, Angular, or Vue.js) for a responsive user interface. The back-end is often built with languages like Node.js, Python (Django or Flask), or Java (Spring Boot) along with a database system such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or MongoDB for data storage. For real-time features or simulations, WebSockets or APIs may be used. The software may also utilize cloud platforms (AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure) for hosting, scalability, and data security, along with version control systems like Git for collaborative development.

### Dependencies

The dependencies for a web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software may vary depending on the specific technology stack used, but here are some common dependencies that would be included:

1. **Front-End Dependencies:**
   - **React / Angular / Vue.js**: For building the user interface and managing state.
   - **Redux / Context API**: For state management (in the case of React).
   - **Bootstrap / Material UI / Tailwind CSS**: For UI components and styling.
   - **Axios / Fetch API**: For making HTTP requests to the server.
   - **Socket.io**: If real-time communication (e.g., live interviews, chats) is required.

2. **Back-End Dependencies:**
   - **Node.js**: For server-side JavaScript execution.
   - **Express.js**: A minimal web application framework for Node.js.
   - **Django / Flask**: For Python-based back-end solutions.
   - **Spring Boot**: For Java-based back-end development.
   - **JWT / OAuth**: For user authentication and authorization.
   - **Bcrypt / Argon2**: For password hashing and security.

3. **Database Dependencies:**
   - **MySQL / PostgreSQL**: For relational databases and SQL queries.
   - **MongoDB**: If a NoSQL solution is needed for storing flexible data.
   - **Sequelize / TypeORM**: For ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) with SQL databases.
   - **Mongoose**: For MongoDB interactions.

4. **Real-Time & API Dependencies:**
   - **Socket.io**: For real-time communication (if live simulations are needed).
   - **GraphQL / REST API**: For handling communication between the front end and back end.
   
5. **Testing & Development Dependencies:**
   - **Jest / Mocha / Chai**: For unit testing and test automation.
   - **Cypress / Selenium**: For end-to-end testing.
   - **ESLint / Prettier**: For code linting and formatting.

6. **DevOps & Deployment Dependencies:**
   - **Docker**: For containerizing the application.
   - **Kubernetes**: For managing containerized services (optional).
   - **Nginx / Apache**: For web server configurations.
   - **AWS / Google Cloud / Azure SDKs**: For cloud-based hosting and services.

These dependencies form the core elements needed to build a robust, scalable, and secure web-based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software.
